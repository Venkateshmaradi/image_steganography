The objective of the project is to hide a secret text file withinan image file in BMP format. This is achieved by first encodingthe length of the secret text and then encoding the actual datainto the least significant bits (LSB) of the image bytes. Thedecoding process involves extracting the length informationand then decoding the text bit by bit from the LSB of theimage bytes. The final output of the decoding process is thesecret text, which is retrieved by reconstructing the originaldata from the encoded bits
